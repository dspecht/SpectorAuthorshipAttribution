	February 22, 1732 a man was born with a great power and a great destiny. This is the story of Henry Jacobs and the secret that the world never knew.
	The sound of muskets and cannons filled the air, enemy forces were quickly advancing. Outnumbered and outmatched general Washington was forced to use it. Closing his eyes, he concentrated then rushed forward with talwar in hand he dodged every shot fired at him and slashed every foe he came across. The enemy could not hit him not even at close range. His actions inspired his troop and he gave the call, “Charge!” the troops charged in with their rekindled spirits, taking that which they lost, a fight for independence and freedom.
	After several ours the battle had ended with several dead and much more wounded, no one had ever seen a man be able to move so quickly yet so elegant. The men wanted to know how he did it, but he could not even explain it himself, all he knew was he became aware of this skill when he was young.
	Several years ago when Henry was still an ordinary everyday teen, he led a good life except whenever he went to school. Every day before school he would always encounter bullies that would take his snacks and lunch, at school he had no friend because everyone was a afraid that if they got to close to him they would also be picked on, and after school Henry would sometimes get beaten up. However, one day everything changed for young Henry, but he would not find out till later. After cutting down a cherry tree he saw two curious cherries, which looked very delicious, but Henry was weary upon deciding if they were, so he gave one to a bird and after waiting several he did not notice anything strange so he decided that they were safe. He ate the cherry and it was the most delicious thing he has ever eaten. Several days later it was time for Henry’s routinely session of getting beaten up, but something was different this time, he had this odd sensation rising up within him. He saw something that he was not meant to see. He saw himself getting beaten up, but it was not happening to him right now in his present self. He saw the bully throw a right hook towards his face and after a few moments he came back to his senses and saw the bully still standing in front of him, but moments later he was hit right in the face by the bully just as he saw earlier. At that moment Henry realized he had the power of precognition. He got back up his feet and the bull threw another punch, but it did not connect then he threw another and another all missed. The bully became infuriated and charged Henry, but he was able dodge it while simultaneously tripping the bully. Henry felt that he power for the first time in his life, that he was unstoppable.
	The following years Henry began to use his power more and more, but not for the right reason. Henry became known as the Phantom Thief. He would rob many banks and no one would even catch a glimpse of him, he would use his power to see where the guards would come from and when they would leave and he would use his powers to avoid the cops, he became uncatchable; until one night during a heist he was caught and hit in the head rendering him unconscious. Waking up in a cell wondered why he did not foresee the guard. He tried using his power several times in his cell and he finally noticed his powers were beginning to weaken, that he could not use it as much and could not see as far as he used to and he felt weaken, drained of energy after using his power. All Henry could do now was waiting in his cell and sleep, until man showed up and told him that he would be executed. Henry became fearful and weak just as he was in his school days. Two men came to his cell to take him to his execution, his public execution to make an example out of him, but Henry was ready, he concentrated saw what he needed to see, he knew what had to be done. Henry rushed the guards as they open his. The Guards swung their batons at him, but Henry already knew they would so he dodge the first one and block the other one, then he proceed to knock the first one down then disarm the second one, next he fought them using their own baton against them, knocking them out. Henry ran to the police stables while evading the other policemen and stealing a horse he rode away without stopping for two whole days and three whole nights. After stopping he only rested for a couple of ours because he knew that the police would not let the Phantom Thief get away so easily. He ran for months and hid for many years until he knew the police had given up and even then he hid for a few more.
	After he made sure he was safe Henry decide he would once again make a name for himself. However it was not going to be the Phantom Thief everyone knew was Henry Jacobs, it was going to be under the name George Washington. George knew also he could not make an infamous name for himself with his weakening power, so he had to make an honest good name for himself and he saw the American Revolution as his ticket to becoming famous. So he joined the military and he showed excellent marksmanship and close quarters combat, but in reality he was only using his power to avoid getting injured and landing solid blows. With his exceptional combat ability he easily rose to the rank of general.
	Present day after the hard battle Washington and his men were exhausted. With depleted rations there was no telling how many would survive the journey back to their base. They marched for several days which seemed like an eternity. Many men collapsed and fell ill. Upon reaching the base it seemed as though they had lost more men on the journey back than on the battlefield. After a week they went back to the frontlines, but this time something strange happened on their journey. A strange glow filled the night sky like never before seen. The sky was illuminated with streaks of green, blue, and purple. The troops were curious and so was Washington. They headed towards where the strange glow originated from then all of a sudden a burst of bright light appeared and blinded them putting them in a daze and causing confusion. After regaining their sight their troops all look bewildered and the strange lights in the sky could no longer be seen. Everybody wondered what they had just witness. Without being able to come to a conclusion they proceeded to leave and head to the battlefield.  
	Upon reaching the battlefield and charging in, they met a group of British soldiers like they have never seen. The British had weapons so powerful and accurate that shot many rounds without reloading, guns that more than one projectile and canons that tore the field asunder. Washington was force to retreat. Only a small group of five men including Washington were able to escape the massacre. Washington and his men were bewildered by the British’s immense firepower, how could they have gotten that much stronger in one week.
	Making their way back to their base they encountered a British scout. Luckily the scout had not seen them yet. Washington used his powers to figure out the easiest way to take the scout by surprise and captured him. After figuring out what needed to be done he told his men to wait where they are and he proceeded to sneak up on the scout and whacked him on the head rendering him unconscious. Washington tied the scout up and questioned him.
	“Where did you get these weapons?” questioned Washington.
	“What are you talking about? We’ve been using these guns for years.” exclaimed the scout.
	“Don’t lie to me. Only last week you red coats have been using these muskets.”
	“What are you talking about? Why would we be using those ancient rifles?”
	What do you mean ancient? These muskets are not even five years old.”
	“Are you sure you’re alright? Those things haven’t even been used since the 1500’s.”
	“I had enough of your lies!” Washington exclaimed as he knocked the British scout unconscious. “What could this mean? I’m sure they were using standard muskets just a week ago. If there military power has grown this exponentially, I have to warn the other, I need to get back to the base.”
	Washington and his men rushed to their base carrying grave news. Upon reaching the base Washington was questioned.
	“Who goes their?” questioned the guard.
	“General Washington and I bring grave news about the British forces. Let me see your commanding officer.” answered Washington.
	“General Washington eh? Never heard that name before, but you are wearing a general’s uniform. Follow me.” 
	Washington followed guard to a big decorated room where the base commanding officer resided.
	“Sir, I come bearing grave news.” exclaimed Washington.
	“What? Who are you?” questioned the commanding officer.
	“General Washington sir! The British have greatly upgraded their arsenal. They have these strange guns.” Washington said as he pointed at the handgun and rifle he took from the British scout.
	“What’s this general. Are you trying to make a fool out of me? What is so strange about them? The British have been using these for years; we have been using them for years. Now that I think of it I have never even heard about a general name Washington let alone the name Washington. For all I know you could be a spy. Guards arrest this man and his men!” exclaimed the commanding officer.
	A group of soldiers rushed into the room, but they were not able to catch Washington. He moved too quickly. He dodged every attempt they made to capture him. They started shooting at him, but that was no good either. Washington then made his move and stopped the guards and knocked them out.
	“I don’t know what going on, but the one thing I’m sure of is that I’m not a British soldier I’m an American!” proclaimed Washington.
	Washington rushed outside only to find that three of his men were shot and killed while the other two were beaten to a pulp and could not move. There was nothing Washington could do for his men. Washington sneaked around the base and stumbled upon the armory. He took a gun that was labeled “Machine Gun” and one labeled “Handgun”. Then Washington found the kitchen where he took some rations before leaving. He hid in the base until nightfall where he was able to make his escape.
	After wandering around for several days, one night he saw the strange lights in the sky again and he knew that if he followed them he might be able to make it back. He headed towards the lights and once again was blinded by the bright white light. When he regain his vision he saw large buildings piercing the sky and he knew right away he did not make it back, but he knew that if that strange occurrence happened twice at the same spot it was bound to happen again. Washington began to believe that this place was some link to other worlds. So Washington waited and waited, only leaving when he was low on rations, until he was back to a place that look familiar, that filled him with a nostalgic feeling and at that moment he knew he was back to his world. 
	Washington rushed back to the base a reported to his commanding officer who thought that he was dead because he had been missing for two months. Washington showed them the weapons he hand found, he showed them how deadlier they were, how much more precise they were compared to their muskets and pistols. For his findings Washington received only praise and no punishment for his disappearance of himself and his men. A group of men got to work and reverse engineered the bullets and guns, until after a couple of months they were able to build hundreds. Washington army was the first to be outfitted with the new weapons and so had begun his path to great military success. He won battle after battle losing only three to five men each battle. Washington had regained that feeling of being unstoppable, but his power of foresight had become very dull over the course of the war.
	At Washington final battle he led a glorious charge; however during this battle he was unable to foresee the near future. Yet he fought on hard and inspired his men. Unfortunately for Washington he was hit several times causing him to become gravely injured.
	Washington was sent to hospital for several months. He was told that he would never walk again. Washington however would not give up, he would try to walk, but at every attempt he would fall. He did this for some time until he finally gave up. After a couple of months had passed Washington had an ingenious idea. He left his home and wheeled himself away and disappeared without saying a word. He rode hard and long until he reached the place where the lights shown in the sky, the place that would take him to other worlds. Every world he visited was just like his, they had won the war, but at the same time every world was different. Some were more advance and some were much more primitive. Washington kept traveling till he found the right world, the world that seemed a thousand years ahead of them. 
	Washington wandered around until he found what he was looking for, a doctor that could fix him up, one that allowed him to be able to walk again. The doctor told Washington that the chance of him surviving the procedure was less than ten percent, but Washington did not care he wanted to walk again, he wanted to feel alive again. Washington went under heavy surgery. It took several days to complete, there were even times when the doctors believe that he would not make it and there were other times when the doctors would actually lose Washington for a several seconds and times where they lost him for minutes. When Washington finally emerged he was more machine than human. The doctor told him he would have to undergo plastic surgery, so they could recreate his original face instead of it looking like a robot. Washington again agreed. After all the surgeries Washington looked his original self, yet he felt stronger and healthier.
	Washington then made his way back to his world even though it took him several weeks. When he finally got back and reintroduced himself to the world the people were astonished that he could walk again. People were calling him the man of miracles; first he was able to turn the tide against the British, now he was able to walk again despite being told that he would never walk again. 
	After a couple of months Washington was ask if he wanted to be the figure head of the country, if he wanted to lead the United States into the future. Washington gladly accepted. He worked hard to change the future. He encountered many problems, but was able to overcome them all. After the Washington’s farewell address and after his second term Washington fell weakened, nearing death, he knew his heart was weakening, but he knew what he had to do, he had to disappear from this world as George Washington. Washington sneaked away and disappeared from his country, he headed to that place again. Washington traveled to worlds until he found the world that had the technology that would be able to do organ transplants on him and give him another life. He paid large sums of money and was finally able to regain his strength and his health, but he knew that he would not be able to return his world looking like George Washington, he did not want to give the people the impression that he some kind of witch or sorcerer. Washington decided to get plastic surgery and get his whole physic change. Washington then took on a new name as well. He looked exactly like the John Adams in his world so he gave himself the name as John Adams. Now as John Adams, Washington came up with a brilliant idea. That he would take the real John Adams place who had become president in his world.
	Washington now as John Adams traveled back to his world where he headed to the capital to where the real John Adams lived. Washington watched John Adams wherever he went looking for the right chance to strike. When John Adams was finally alone Washington made his move. He killed John Adam, then he proceeded to drag the body and he threw it into a cart which he took to a lake. Washington then threw John Adams onto a boat he had prepared in advanced and then he rowed to the middle of the lake, tied stones to John Adams corpse and threw him into the river. Washington was able to replace John Adams.
	Several days passed and no one even knew, they did not even know that he was not the real John Adams; they did not know that the real one was sleeping with the fishes. The new John Adams went on with running the country and when he was near death he would travel to the other worlds and would repeat the process becoming the next president each time. He did this fifteen times. Then on April 11, 1865 he went to see the play “Our American Cousin” and unfortunately for him he was shot and killed by John Wilkes Booth who had discovered his secret. And so ends the tale if of Henry Jacobs, the man who lived more lives than anyone should.
